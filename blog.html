	            <h2 class="mb-3 font-weight-bold" id="Connect-with-customers">How do you connect better with customers?</h2>
	            <p>Customer service is important. And I bet this is not the first time you've heard something like that. Why then do companies and sales representatives fail at it? Why are they not connecting well enough with customers? For many years now, I have worked as a salesperson in the media and sales sector, helping my employees drive sales through customer engagements. One major thing I have learned and use effectively is empathy, which is the key to connecting better with customers. That brings us to "how to best connect with customers."</p>

	            </p>
	            <h3 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">But first, why is it important to connect with customers?</h3>
	            <ol>
					<li>So they would trust you. Trust has been proven to be why customers stay loyal to a particular brand or company. Once trust is established, selling to them would be easy. They would always come to you with whatever related problems they had. You'd always be their go-to person.</li>
					<li>They would refer their friends and families. The best means of marketing is when the customers are the ones doing the marketing. How would you feel if, instead of a marketer telling you about a product, your best friend or partner is saying, "hey buddy, I got this product from Omar, and it is the best I have used so far?" I bet you'd trust those words more than it comes from a paid advertisement.</li>
					<li>Repeat buy is guaranteed once they trust you. The customers are consistently coming back for me.</li>
					<li>Friendship, they see you as their friend, and some of them would always want a reason to talk to you and what is the best reason to engage you rather than inquiring about your product. This allows pitching your latest products to them. Even if they do not need it, they would tell a friend that probably knows a friend that needs it.</li>
					<li>They become part of the company. They are already marketing your products; they would also be there for research purposes. For you to test new products and get early reviews.</li>
				</ol>
	            <h3 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">How then do you connect better with your customers?</h3>
				<img src="images/compassion-empathy.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
				<br>
				<p></p>
	            <ol>
					<li>Be where they are: where are your customers? On social media? Be there with them, and have an active presence on social media. Engage them, and comment on their related posts. This would give them the confidence that you are available and around the corner to listen to their concerns. They would trust you more.</li>
					<li>Make your engagement with them personal and not transactional. Offer to help, do not offer to sell. Tell them about someone with similar problems and how you solved them. Tell them about the solution, then tell them what you have that can provide such a solution. </li>
					<li>Listen to them, and demonstrate an understanding of their difficulties or complaints. Put yourself in their shoes, help them redefine their issues in such a way they would reply, "yes, that is the issue," suggest a solution, and ensure their response is "that is what I want," before proceeding to sell your product.</li>
					<li>Treat your customers individually and as a person, not some characters or figures on a target list. </li>
					<li>Do something they didn't ask you to do, but you think they needed or would help them. Or, in a better case, ask them why they haven't done it. Especially something that won't cost them anything for you to help. </li>
					<li>Hire an expert to help. I am available to help as your part-time social media manager and sales assistant. I am also open to full-time job opportunities. Furthermore, I would also be glad to provide any short-term assistance whenever you require it. You can contact me through my email: <a href="mailto:omar-q@outlook.com"><span class="icon icon-envelope"></span><span class="text">omar-q@outlook.com</span></a></li>
				</ol>
				<p>Above all, it is about showing empathy, the ability to sense other people's emotions and imagine what someone else might think or feel. By putting yourself in their shoes, then it becomes easy to tackle their problems. It is an act I have mastered, and I am available to help use it to drive sales and connect your brand more with the customers.</p>
